This award-winning Flask application combines cutting-edge machine learning and web technologies to deliver personalized recipe recommendations. By integrating APIs and web scraping, it tailors results based on user searches, with advanced filters for dietary preferences, intolerances, and medical conditions. A custom health score for each recipe is calculated using a LightGBM gradient boosting model, enhanced with feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and feature selection to optimize performance and accuracy. The model also utilizes data preprocessing techniques like normalization and one-hot encoding, ensuring the best possible predictions. Recognized for its innovation, this app earned the "Honorable Mention" in the Congressional App Challenge and was commended by Congressman Tom Kean of New Jersey's District 7.
